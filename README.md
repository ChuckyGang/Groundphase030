# Groundphase030

This is my test of doing a very VERY simple 030 card for the Amiga 3000/4000 (only tested on 4000)
It breaks all designrules there is.  This is/was just a proof of concept.

it REQUIRES a FPU installed.

Produce cards if you like to or do stuff with this. but please.. OPEN!

Note, this IS a 4 layer board!
